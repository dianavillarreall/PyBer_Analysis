Performing analysis on ridesharing data provided by the company PyBer to create visual illustration to better understand information.

## Overview of the Aalysis

### Purpose
This analysis was created to summarize the ride-sharing data provided dependign on the city type and to provide graphs with the total weekly fares also depending in the type of city. By creating different tables and graphs according to their outcomes it will be easier to visualize the optimum decision that will ensure the company to succed in the future.

## Results

### Differences in Ride-sharing Data
After creating the graph and table we can see the outstanding differences between city types. The total rides gives us a clear look of how urban cities create more than 68% of the business for the company with 1,625 rides, suburban cities make 26% with 625 rides while the rural area just makes a little over 5% with 125 rides which is correlated to the number of drivers which are 2,405 in urban cities, 490 in the suburbs and 78 in rural areas. 

Looking at the average fare per ride and per rider you can also see the discrepancies when it comes to the prices for rides in each area as it is $34.62 for a ride in an rural area, $30.97 in suburban cities and $24.53 in urban cities, the difference of $10.09 between urban cities and rural areas is so significantt aht it clearly reflects it's effects on the Total Fares as illustrated below.

## Summary

### Recommendations
With all this information in mind, it is recommended for PyBer to acquire more drivers in rural and suburban areas so the services is more accessible all around. PyBer should lower fare rides in urban and suburban areas so people consider using the service more and that way increasing the total rides and everything else after that. Lastly, after making the changes in the company investing in promoting the service more in the other areas rather than in urban cities where people are clearly more informed about it. With these recomendation it is expected for PyBer to increase their success in the future.
